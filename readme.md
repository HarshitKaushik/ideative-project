# ideative-project
Ideative is an open source project with a reddit-like interface and innovative functionality of its own to provide a beautiful way to design and visualize your ideas and improving the brainstorming process with others in teams.

It is a work in progress as we build the backend in Java and frontend in Angular to bring this project to life.
